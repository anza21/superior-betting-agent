# Report 010: Deep JSON Serialization Fix

## Summary
This report documents the comprehensive resolution of the `Object of type Ok is not JSON serializable` error encountered during strategy generation in the agent.

### Actions Taken
1. Modified return statements across multiple files to ensure they return JSON serializable types.
2. Restarted Docker containers to ensure they load the latest code changes.
3. Executed the main script `agent/scripts/main.py` within the Docker container to verify the fix.

### Current Status
- The Docker containers started successfully, and the environment variables were loaded.
- The script executed without encountering the `Object of type Ok is not JSON serializable` error.
- A separate issue related to the CoinGecko API was encountered, which does not affect JSON serialization.

### Next Steps
- Investigate the CoinGecko API issue separately to ensure proper API key usage.
- Continue monitoring the agent's execution to ensure stability and functionality.

This report serves as a record of the successful resolution of the JSON serialization issue and highlights the need for further investigation into the CoinGecko API issue. Further testing and debugging will be conducted to maintain the agent's performance.
