# Report 006: Prompt Template Fix Attempt

## Summary
This report documents the attempt to fix the `KeyError: 'apis_str'` and `KeyError: 'latest_response'` in the agent's prompt generation system.

### Actions Taken
1. Modified `generate_strategy_prompt` in `agent/src/agent/trading.py` to include `apis_str` in the format call.
2. Modified `regen_code` in `agent/src/agent/trading.py` to include `latest_response` in the format call.
3. Ensured that the response from `gen_result.unwrap()` is JSON serializable by converting it to a string or using `json.dumps(response, default=str)`.

### Current Status
- The agent successfully executed the script with the specified configuration.
- The `KeyError` issues were resolved, but a new error `Object of type Ok is not JSON serializable` persists.
- The agent was able to generate research code but failed during strategy generation due to the JSON serialization error.

### Next Steps
- Investigate and fix the `Object of type Ok is not JSON serializable` error by ensuring all objects are properly serialized before being returned or logged.
- Continue testing the agent's execution to ensure all prompt templates and configurations are correctly applied.

This report will be used to guide further debugging and development efforts to ensure the agent operates as expected without errors. The focus will be on resolving the JSON serialization issue and verifying the agent's ability to generate strategies successfully.
