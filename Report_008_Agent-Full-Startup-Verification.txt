# Report 008: Agent Full Startup Verification

## Summary
This report documents the verification of the agent's full startup with configured API keys and the issues encountered during the process.

### Actions Taken
1. Verified that all necessary API keys are correctly placed in the `.env` file.
2. Restarted Docker containers to ensure they load the updated environment variables.
3. Executed the main script `agent/scripts/main.py` within the Docker container to verify the setup.

### Current Status
- The Docker containers started successfully, and the environment variables were loaded.
- The script executed, but the `Object of type Ok is not JSON serializable` error reappeared during strategy generation.

### Next Steps
- Investigate the code related to strategy generation to identify where the `Ok` object is used and ensure proper serialization.
- Continue testing the agent's execution to ensure all configurations are correctly applied.

This report serves as a record of the verification process and highlights the need for further investigation into the JSON serialization issue. Further testing and debugging will be conducted to resolve the issue and ensure the agent's functionality.
