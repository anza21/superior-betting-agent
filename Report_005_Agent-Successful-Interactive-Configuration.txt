# Report 005: Agent Successful Interactive Configuration
Date: 2025-08-01
Role: Role B (AI Assistant)

## Summary of Work Completed

This report documents the successful completion of Phase 5 of the Superior Agents Framework setup for the Arbitrum Sports Oracle Agent. The primary goal was to successfully complete the interactive setup of the agent after fixing the environment variable loading issue.

## Steps Executed

### 1. Docker Container Environment Setup
- Confirmed all Docker containers were running after the environment variable fix from Report 004
- Successfully entered the agent container using `docker-compose -f docker-compose.quickstart.yml exec -it agent sh`
- Container environment confirmed to be operational

### 2. Interactive Agent Setup Script Execution
Multiple attempts were made to run `python scripts/main.py` with the following configurations:

#### Successful Configuration Selections:
1. **LLM Model**: OpenAI (selected correctly)
2. **Research Tools**: CoinGecko (selected correctly)
3. **Notification Channels**: business_news, general_news, sports_news, world_news_news (selected correctly)
4. **Agent Type**: trading (selected correctly)
5. **RAG API Setup**: "Yes, i have setup the RAG" (selected correctly, confirmed connection to RAG service on port 8080)

### 3. API Key Configuration Attempts
The script prompted for API keys interactively:
- **COINGECKO_API_KEY**: Attempted with `CG-BRtYodTmjhUAd3f9CxJYSbLx`
- **INFURA_PROJECT_ID**: Attempted with `1a5e5cadb4ab4e8d964e45d59690168a`
- **ETHERSCAN_API_KEY**: Attempted with `PTF15GYG6B`

### 4. Issues Encountered

#### Issue 1: API Key Loading
- The script requested API keys interactively instead of reading them from the `.env` file
- This indicates a potential issue with how the script handles environment variables when certain options are selected

#### Issue 2: CoinGecko API Error
- The provided CoinGecko API key resulted in: `400 Client Error: Bad Request`
- This suggests either an invalid API key or incorrect API endpoint usage

#### Issue 3: Code Bugs
- Multiple `KeyError` exceptions were encountered:
  - `KeyError: 'apis_str'` in the strategy generation
  - `KeyError: 'latest_response'` in the code regeneration
- These indicate missing template variables in the prompt generation system

### 5. Current Status

While the interactive configuration was completed with all correct selections, the agent failed to start properly due to:
1. Invalid or improperly formatted API keys
2. Bugs in the prompt template system
3. The script not reading API keys from the `.env` file as expected

The environment variable loading issue from previous reports has been resolved (docker-compose.quickstart.yml now correctly points to `./.env`), but the agent requires valid API keys and bug fixes to function properly.

## Verification Results

✅ **Docker containers**: All running successfully
✅ **RAG API connection**: Successfully connected on port 8080
✅ **Interactive selections**: All made correctly according to instructions
❌ **API key validation**: Failed due to invalid CoinGecko API key
❌ **Agent startup**: Failed due to code bugs in prompt templates

## Git Changes Made

No code changes were made in this phase. The primary activity was interactive configuration testing.

## Recommendations for Next Steps

1. Verify all API keys in the `.env` file are valid and properly formatted
2. Fix the KeyError bugs in the agent's prompt generation system
3. Investigate why the script requests API keys interactively when "Yes, i have these keys" is selected
4. Consider using Mock APIs initially to bypass API key issues during testing

## Conclusion

The interactive configuration process was successfully completed with all correct selections. However, the agent requires valid API keys and bug fixes before it can begin its trading operations. The foundation is properly set up, but operational issues need to be resolved.
