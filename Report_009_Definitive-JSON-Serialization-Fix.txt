# Report 009: Definitive JSON Serialization Fix

## Summary
This report documents the attempt to definitively resolve the `Object of type Ok is not JSON serializable` error encountered during strategy generation in the agent.

### Actions Taken
1. Modified the `gen_strategy` function in `agent/src/agent/trading.py` to ensure the response is returned as a JSON serializable string.
2. Restarted Docker containers to ensure they load the latest code changes.
3. Executed the main script `agent/scripts/main.py` within the Docker container to verify the fix.

### Current Status
- The Docker containers started successfully, and the environment variables were loaded.
- The script executed, but the `Object of type Ok is not JSON serializable` error reappeared during strategy generation.

### Next Steps
- Investigate further to identify all instances where the `Ok` object is used and ensure proper serialization.
- Continue testing the agent's execution to ensure all configurations are correctly applied.

This report serves as a record of the attempt to resolve the JSON serialization issue and highlights the need for further investigation. Further testing and debugging will be conducted to resolve the issue and ensure the agent's functionality.
