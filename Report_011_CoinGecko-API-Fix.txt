# Report: CoinGecko API Fix

## Summary
This report details the investigation into the CoinGecko API issue within the trading agent. The investigation focused on ensuring that API requests are correctly formatted and responses are properly handled.

## Investigation Details
- **Classes Analyzed**: 
  - `TradingAgent`: Responsible for executing trading strategies and includes methods that interact with the CoinGecko API.
  - `TradingPromptGenerator`: Generates prompts for API calls, including those to CoinGecko.
  - `Genner` and `OllamaGenner`: Handle code generation based on prompts.

- **Key Findings**:
  - The `generate_address_research_code_prompt` method in `TradingPromptGenerator` is used to create prompts for CoinGecko API calls.
  - The `OllamaGenner` class implements the `generate_code` method, which processes chat history and extracts code, including API calls.
  - No existing test cases directly verify the API call code generated for CoinGecko.

## Recommendations
- Implement a test case that uses the `generate_address_research_code_prompt` to verify the correctness of API requests.
- Ensure that all necessary parameters and headers are included in the API requests.

## Conclusion
The investigation identified areas for improvement in testing the CoinGecko API interactions. Implementing the recommended test case will help ensure the reliability of API requests and responses.
