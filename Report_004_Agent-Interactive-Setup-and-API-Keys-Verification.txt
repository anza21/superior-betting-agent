# Agent Interactive Setup and API Keys Verification Report

## Docker Container Setup Results

1. **Container Restart Status:**
   - All containers were successfully stopped and removed
   - New containers were built and started successfully
   - Container IDs verified and running:
     - rag-api: Running on 0.0.0.0:8080 (health check passing)
     - agent: Running with sleep infinity
     - meta-swap-api: Running on 0.0.0.0:9009
     - agent-executor: Running

2. **Environment Variables Status:**
   - The same configuration issues persist after restart:
     - Ethereum private key still shows as `0xyour_eth_private_key`
     - API keys are still missing ("At least one API key is required")
     - OKX API keys not configured
   - This confirms the .env file was not properly updated before the restart

3. **Interactive Setup Progress:**
   - Multiple attempts to run the setup script
   - First attempt: User selected wrong LLM (Gemini instead of OpenAI)
   - Second attempt showed progress through multiple prompts:
     - LLM selection
     - Research tools selection (Twitter, DuckDuckGo, CoinGecko options shown)
     - Notification channels (business_news, general_news, sports_news, world_news_news selected)
     - Agent type: "trading" was selected
     - RAG API: "Yes, i have setup the RAG" option available
   - Script prompted for multiple API keys:
     - TWITTER_API_KEY
     - TWITTER_API_KEY_SECRET
     - TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN
     - TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
     - TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN
     - COINGECKO_API_KEY
     - INFURA_PROJECT_ID and ETHERSCAN_API_KEY options

## Observations

1. **Script Functionality Confirmed:**
   - The setup script is working correctly and progressing through all configuration steps
   - It properly detects when certain services need API keys
   - The script offers both mock options and real API integration options

2. **Critical Configuration Issue:**
   - The environment variables have not been updated in the .env file
   - The containers are loading the same default/placeholder values
   - Without proper API keys, the agent cannot function in production mode

3. **Setup Flow Understanding:**
   - The script follows a logical flow: LLM → Research Tools → Notifications → Agent Type → RAG → API Keys
   - Mock options are available for testing without real APIs
   - The script is designed to collect all necessary configuration interactively

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions Required:**
   - The .env file must be updated with actual API keys and Ethereum private key
   - All placeholder values must be replaced with real credentials
   - Containers need to be restarted after .env file updates

2. **Script Execution Strategy:**
   - When running the script, ensure to:
     - Select "OpenAI" for LLM model
     - Select appropriate research tools (at least CoinGecko for crypto prices)
     - Select relevant notification channels
     - Choose "trading" for agent type
     - Select "Yes, i have setup the RAG" if RAG is running
     - Provide all requested API keys or choose mock options for testing

## Next Steps

1. Update the .env file with all required credentials
2. Restart containers to load the new environment variables
3. Execute the setup script with proper interactive responses
4. Complete all prompts without cancellation
5. Verify that the agent starts without configuration errors

## Final Resolution

1. **Root Cause Identified and Fixed:**
   - The docker-compose.quickstart.yml was looking for `./examples/.env.quickstart`
   - This file did not exist, causing environment variables to not load
   - Changed all `env_file` entries to point to `./.env` in the root directory
   - The .env file exists (261 bytes) and contains the proper configurations

2. **Verification of Fix:**
   - After updating docker-compose.yml and restarting containers
   - meta-swap-api now shows: "Loaded wallets 1" 
   - No more "invalid BytesLike value" errors
   - The ETH_PRIVATE_KEY is now loading correctly from .env

3. **Current Status:**
   - All containers running successfully
   - Environment variables are being loaded properly
   - The setup script is accessible and runs
   - Ready for interactive configuration

## Git Changes Made
- Modified `docker-compose.quickstart.yml`: Changed `./examples/.env.quickstart` to `./.env` (3 occurrences)
