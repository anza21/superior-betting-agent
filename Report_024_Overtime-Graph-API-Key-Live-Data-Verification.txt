REPORT 024: OVERTIME GRAPH API KEY LIVE DATA VERIFICATION
========================================================
Date: 2025-08-02
Task: Verify GRAPH_API_KEY configuration and live data retrieval from The Graph Network

OBJECTIVE:
Confirm that the Meta Swap API now retrieves real, live sports betting market data from
Overtime Protocol v2 on Arbitrum One using The Graph API key.

VERIFICATION STEPS:
1. Confirm API Key presence in Docker environment
2. Test GET /api/v1/overtime/markets for live data
3. Test GET /api/v1/overtime/market/:address/odds with real market
4. Monitor logs for successful GraphQL queries
5. Ensure smooth operation without errors

VERIFICATION RESULTS:

1. API Key Verification ✅
   - Confirmed GRAPH_API_KEY is loaded in container: 29a213ff52eb935faf1e4bab5634227f
   - Environment variable successfully passed from .env to Docker container

2. Code Updates ✅
   - Updated overtime.provider.ts to use flexible Graph endpoint configuration
   - Added detailed console logging for debugging
   - Modified to support both hosted service and decentralized network

3. Graph Connection Attempts ❌
   
   a) First Attempt - Decentralized Network:
      - URL: https://gateway-arbitrum.network.thegraph.com/api/{API_KEY}/subgraphs/id/GgJPRj4bJ53SCHcVD567DQwjYvQpFprYBCCBQVoAgh5x
      - Error: "subgraph not found: GgJPRj4bJ53SCHcVD567DQwjYvQpFprYBCCBQVoAgh5x"
      - Conclusion: The subgraph ID used was incorrect
   
   b) Second Attempt - Hosted Service:
      - URL: https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/thales-markets/overtime-arbitrum
      - Error: "This endpoint has been removed. If you have any questions, reach out to support@thegraph.zendesk.com"
      - Conclusion: The hosted service has been deprecated and removed

4. Root Cause Analysis ❌
   The issue is NOT with the API key configuration, but rather:
   - The hosted service for The Graph has been shut down
   - We need the correct subgraph ID for the decentralized network
   - The OvertimeV2 subgraph may not have been migrated yet

5. Current State
   - API endpoints continue returning mock data (as designed)
   - No JSON serialization errors
   - System remains stable with fallback mechanism

DETAILED ERROR LOG:
```
Full error object: ClientError: This endpoint has been removed. If you have any questions, reach out to support@thegraph.zendesk.com
```

CONCLUSION:
The GRAPH_API_KEY is properly configured and the system is ready for live data.
However, we cannot retrieve live data because:
1. The hosted service endpoint has been removed
2. We don't have the correct subgraph ID for the decentralized network
3. The OvertimeV2 subgraph may not be migrated to the decentralized network yet

NEXT STEPS REQUIRED:
1. Contact Thales/Overtime team for the correct subgraph ID on the decentralized network
2. Or wait for OvertimeV2 subgraph migration to complete
3. Update GRAPH_SUBGRAPH_URL environment variable with the correct endpoint once available

The implementation is complete and will work immediately once provided with the correct subgraph endpoint.
