# Agent Configuration and Initial Run Report

## Docker Container Setup Results

- The Docker containers were built and started successfully.
- The `rag-api` service started and is running on `http://0.0.0.0:8080`.

## Issues Encountered

- There is a persistent error with the Ethereum private key (`0xyour_eth_private_key`) indicating it is not set correctly.
- The error message suggests an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` for the Ethereum private key, which needs to be corrected in the environment configuration.
- API keys for some services are missing or not configured correctly, as indicated by the logs.

## Recommendations

- Verify that the Ethereum private key is correctly set in the `.env` file or as an environment variable in the Docker container.
- Ensure all necessary API keys (OpenAI, CoinGecko, Infura, Etherscan) are correctly configured.
- Restart the Docker containers after making the necessary changes to apply the updates.
