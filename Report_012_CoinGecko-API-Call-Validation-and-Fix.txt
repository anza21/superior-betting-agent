# Report: CoinGecko API Call Validation and Fix

## Summary
This report details the attempts to resolve the issue with running tests for the CoinGecko API calls within the trading agent. Despite multiple attempts, the tests could not be executed successfully due to import errors.

## Attempts Made
- **Directory Structure Check**: Verified the directory structure to ensure all files are in the correct place.
- **PYTHONPATH Configuration**: Attempted to set the PYTHONPATH to include the correct paths for module imports.
- **Docker Containers**: Started Docker containers to ensure the environment is correctly set up.
- **Virtual Environment**: Activated the virtual environment to ensure all dependencies are available.
- **Test Execution**: Tried running the test using various methods, including direct execution and using unittest discover.

## Current Status
The tests for the CoinGecko API calls are still failing due to import errors, specifically with the `agent.tests` module. The issue seems to be related to module import paths or environment configuration.

## Recommendations
- Review the module import paths and ensure they are correctly configured.
- Verify the environment setup, including Docker and virtual environment configurations.
- Consider seeking assistance from a developer with experience in Python testing and environment setup.
